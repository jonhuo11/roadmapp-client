# Official roadmapp Mobile Client
This is the official mobile client for the roadmapp task management app, maintained by [@jonhuo11](https://jonhuo11.github.io).

For those interested in learning more about roadmapp, a link to the roadmapp website will be provided soon.

# Future plans
Eventually, I hope to fully document the REST API for roadmapp's database and make it open to the public, so anyone can make their own, custom roadmapp client. You can think of this as something similar to [third-party Reddit clients](https://apolloapp.io). Reddit has its own database that stores user content, 100% hosted and managed by the company. Reddit also provides an official mobile app for its users to interface with its database. However, they have published documentation of a REST API for accessing their services, so that third-party programmers can make their own clients with custom functionality and appearance. I like this idea and hope to make roadmapp similarly accessible one day.
